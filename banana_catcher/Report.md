# Report of Assignment
The submission includes a file in the root of the GitHub repository or zip file (one of Report.md, Report.ipynb, or Report.pdf) that provides a description of the implementation.

## Learning Algorithm
The report clearly describes the learning algorithm, along with the chosen hyperparameters. It also describes the model architectures for any neural networks.


## Plof of Rewards
A plot of rewards per episode is included to illustrate that the agent is able to receive an average reward (over 100 episodes) of at least +13. The submission reports the number of episodes needed to solve the environment.
