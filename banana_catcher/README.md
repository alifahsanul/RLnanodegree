# Deep Reinforcement Learning Project 1
# Unity Banana Navigation
## Project Details
* This project is the first mandatory project in Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree.
* The goal is to train an agent to play a game where the agent has to collect as many yellow banana as possible and avoiding blue banana. The rewards are as follows:
  * +1 for interaction with yellow banana
  * -1 for interaction with blue banana
  * 0 for else
* There are 4 possible actions:
  * *0* - move forward
